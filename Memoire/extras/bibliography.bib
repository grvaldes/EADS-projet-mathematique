  abstract = {Analytical strategies are discussed to study trends in data from repeated social survey research with correspondence analysis. By adding time to the contingency table, changing social categories can be studied over time with composite, multiple, or joint correspondence analysis. Doing so, one has to assume a stable society. By adding time twice, changing social categories can be studied in the context of their changing society. This last analytical strategy is illustrated with the case of the membership of Dutch broadcasting associations in changing Dutch society of the last decades (1979\textendash 2005).},

  abstract = {The data-driven computing paradigm initially introduced by Kirchdoerfer and Ortiz (2016) enables finite element computations in solid mechanics to be performed directly from material data sets, without an explicit material model. From a computational effort point of view, the most challenging task is the projection of admissible states at material points onto their closest states in the material data set. In this study, we compare and develop several possible data structures for solving the nearest-neighbor problem. We show that approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) algorithms can accelerate material data searches by several orders of magnitude relative to exact searching algorithms. The approximations are suggested by\textendash and adapted to\textendash the structure of the data-driven iterative solver and result in no significant loss of solution accuracy. We assess the performance of the ANN algorithm with respect to material data set size with the aid of a 3D elasticity test case. We show that computations on a single processor with up to one billion material data points are feasible within a few seconds execution time with a speedup of more than 106 with respect to exact k-d trees.},

  abstract = {When the conservation equations for mass, chemical species, momentum and energy were derived in the previous chapter, it became soon evident that the number of unknown functions was far larger than that of the equations. To allow the closure of the problem some quantities need to be related to others and to the properties of matter, and these are the diffusive mass fluxes, j(p)j(p)\textbackslash mathbf \{j\}\^\{\textbackslash left( p\textbackslash right) \}, the deviatoric stress tensor, {$\tau$}jk{$\tau$}jk\textbackslash tau \_\{jk\}, the internal energy per unity of mass, u\^u\^\textbackslash hat\{u\} (or the specific enthalpy, h\^h\^\textbackslash hat\{h\}) and the heat flux, qq\textbackslash mathbf \{q\}. The laws that describe these quantities are known as constitutive equations, and in thermo-fluids they are inherently empirical, although they must satisfy some requirement based upon first principles, like the condition of material objectivity (material properties must be independent of observer), the symmetry properties of a material body and the law of thermodynamics (particularly, the entropy inequality).},
